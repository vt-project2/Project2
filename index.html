			<h1 id="TestScope">1. Test Scope</h1>
            <p>This document describes the test specification for the Movie Theater Reservation System designed by Andres Pico (andresjp) and Radha Krishnan Vinayagam (vradha).</p>
            <p>This specification will test the functional requirements revolving around the ability to create user accounts, check seating statuses, and manage reservations. The specification will also test non-functional requirements concerning the client interface, protocol, and performance of the application.</p>
            <p>Note that this document will not be testing non-functional requirements concerning the modifiability or the maintainability of the system during integration or verification testing.</p>
        </section>

			<h1 id="TestPlan">2. Test Plan</h1>
            <p>Integration testing will follow a bottom up approach and proceed against six separate builds of the system. Each one will test a major subsection of functionality. The first build will test the caching functionality, the second the pub/sub functionality, the third the booking functionality, the fourth the user account functionality, the fifth the status functionality, and the sixth will test the load balancing functionality.</p>
            <p>The caching build will consist of the cache component and the database. Testing this build will provide initial assurance of the system’s ability to support all non-functional requirements as well as all functional requirements with the exception of requirement five. Requirement five is not validated in this build since it doesn’t make use of the cache component.</p>
            <p>The pub/sub build will consist of the pub/sub component and the database. In a manner similar to the caching build, this build will provide initial assurance of the system’s ability to support all non-functional requirements as well as functional requirement five. Requirement five is the only functional requirement that uses the pub/sub component.</p>
            <p>The booking module build will consist of the the booking module components as well as the already tested cache and database components. This build will test functional requirements six, seven, and eight as well as all five non-functional performance requirements.</p>
            <p>The user module build will consist of the account module as well as the already tested cache and database components. This build will test functional requirements one, two, three, and four as well as all five non-functional requirements.</p>
            <p>The status module build will consist of the status module as well as the already tested pub/sub and database components. This build will test functional requirement 5 as well as all five non-functional requirements.</p>
            <p>The load balancer build will consist of the the load balancer component as well as the already tested subordinate components. This build will test all functional requirements as well as all five non-functional requirements.</p>
            <p>Conducting integration testing in this sequence will provide optimal assurance that the system is integrated properly, since it starts with the lowest level components and integrates upwards only after verifying the correctness of the lower levels. This sequence is also ideal because it isolates the scope of the search area when problems do arise.</p>

			<h1 id="TestProcedure">3. Test Procedure for Build</h1>
            <section>
			    <h1 id="CachingBuild">3.1 Caching Build</h1>
                <p>The purpose of the caching build is to test the constraint that data should be read from the database only when it does not already appear in the cache. The testing of this build supports the verification of all functional requirements with the exception of requirement number five. This is because each functional requirement will at some point need to read data from the database. Functional requirement five is the one exception to this rule. Although requirement five also reads data from the database, its data must never be cached since it’s expected that it will always be up-to-date. This build will also test non-functional requirements two and three.</p>
                <p>A driver will be written that makes calls to the cache module when data needs to be read from or written to the database.</p>
                <p>The following tests will be performed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>(3.1.1)</b> Read non-existent data from cache - the cache should be unable to find the requested data and should therefore delegate the call to the underlying database. The database should be unable to find the requested data and should return a suitable error message to the cache, which then passes that message back up to the driver.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.1.2)</b> Read existing data not in cache - the cache should be unable to find the requested data and should therefore delegate the call to the underlying database. The database should find the data and return it to the cache. The cache should store the requested data in its data structure before passing the data back up to the driver.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.1.3)</b> Read existing data already found in the cache - the cache should find the requested data in its data structure and return it to the driver without making a request to the database.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.1.4)</b> Create, update, or delete data in the database - the cache should delegate the call to the underlying database. The results of the database update should then be propagated to the cache. Specifically, newly created database rows should find their data placed in the cache. Updated rows should find their corresponding data updated in the cache. If updated rows aren’t currently represented in the cache then they should be added. Deleted rows should have their corresponding data deleted from the cache.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.1.5)</b> Create 1000 random, concurrent, read/write requests - the driver should create 1000 concurrent reads and writes representing a sampling of cached and non-cached data. The response time for each request should be measured to ensure that it is within acceptable constraints.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1 id="PubSubBuild">3.2 Pub/Sub Build</h1>
                <p>The purpose of the pub/sub build is to test the ability of the system to handle asynchronous requests to the database for the latest status information. The testing of this build supports the verification of functional requirement five. None of the other functional requirements are tested here since they do not require the capabilities provided by the pub/sub component. This build will also test non-functional requirements two and three.</p>
                <p>A driver will be written that makes calls to the pub/sub module when data needs to be read from the database.</p>
                <p>The following tests will be performed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>(3.2.1)</b> Send a status read message for a specific account to the pub/sub component - the pub/sub component should accept the request asynchronously and allow the driver to continue processing other requests.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.2.2)</b> Send 1000 concurrent status read messages for different accounts to the pub/sub component - the pub/sub component should process the requests asynchronously and return the resulting status to the driver. The driver will measure the response time for each request to ensure that it is within the acceptable limits.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1 id="BookingBuild">3.3 Booking Build</h1>
                <p>The purpose of the booking build is to test the ability of the system to allow users to create, update, or cancel existing reservations. The testing of this build supports the verification of functional requirements six, seven, and eight. This build will also test non-functional requirements one, two, and three.</p>
                <p>A driver will be written that makes HTTP calls to the booking module when a reservation needs to created, updated, or deleted.</p>
                <p>The following tests will be performed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>(3.3.1)</b> Create a reservation - the booking component should be able to create a reservation for a user. A HTTP request will be sent by the driver to create a new reservation for a given user. The component should successfully create the reservation.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.3.2)</b> Update a reservation - the booking component should be able to update an existing reservation for a user. A HTTP request will be sent by the driver to update an existing reservation for a given user. The component should successfully update the reservation. In case the identified reservation cannot be found an error HTTP response is returned to the driver.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.3.3)</b> Delete a reservation - the booking component should be able to delete an existing reservation for a user. A HTTP request will be sent by the driver to delete an existing reservation for a given user. The component should successfully delete the reservation. In case the identified reservation cannot be found an error HTTP response is returned to the driver.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.3.4)</b> Send 1000 concurrent reservation create, update, and delete requests for different accounts to the booking component. The driver will measure the response time for each request to ensure that it is within the acceptable limits.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The purpose of the user build is to test the ability of the system to allow users to create, update, or delete their user accounts. The testing of this build supports the verification of functional requirements one, two, and three. This build will also test non-functional requirements one, two, and three.</p>
                <p>A driver will be written that makes HTTP calls to the user module when an account needs to be created, updated, or deleted.</p>
                <p>The following tests will be performed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>(3.4.1)</b> Create a user - the user component should be able to create an account for a user. A HTTP request will be sent by the driver to create a new account for a given user. The component should successfully create the account.</li>
                    <li><b>(3.4.2)</b> Update an account - the booking component should be able to update an existing account for a user. A HTTP request will be sent by the driver to update an existing account for a given user. The component should successfully update the account.
